# Identification of Voice Disorderliness using Machine Learning Algorithm

This project focuses on detecting voice disorderliness by analyzing recorded voice samples using **Machine Learning algorithms**.  
It aims to classify voices as **healthy** or **disordered**, and further identify the type of disorder in future enhancements.

## ✨ Features
- Voice recording and dataset creation
- Audio feature extraction (MFCCs, spectral features)
- Machine Learning model for classification (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
- Output: Predicts whether the input voice is healthy or shows disorderliness

## 📌 Current Status
- Dataset preparation completed
- Implemented basic feature extraction
- Preliminary ML model setup in progress

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Improve model accuracy with advanced algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Deep Learning)
- Add noise reduction & better preprocessing
- Build a simple **web interface** for end-user interaction

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Tools:** librosa, scikit-learn, pandas, Flask (planned)
